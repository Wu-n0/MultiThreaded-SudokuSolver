# MultiThreaded-SudokuSolver
Multi Threaded Sudoku Solver which can solve a valid NxN Sudoku.

-Took advantage of parallelism by implementing multi-threading using pthreads in C.

-The program would spawn 'N' threads depending on the input whenever it encountered an empty cell.

-Code was submitted to a server for speed and correctness. Program ran for ~ '0' secs and helped me be in the top 10 of the class leaderboard.
